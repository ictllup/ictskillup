        <h1>Meaning of ICT</h1>
        <h3>
            TERMINOLOGIES DEFINED
            </h3>
           
            <p>There are many terminologies used in the field of computing. Below are some of the basic ones:</p>
        <p>1.	<b>Information and communication Technology (ICT)</b>
            It is the branch of engineering that deals with the use of computers and telecommunications to retrieve, store and transmit information.
            </p>
            <p>2.	The term <b>information technology (IT)</b> is used to describe the use of computers in business, education and everyday life.

            </p>
            <p>3.	<b>Data entry</b>
                It is the act of in putting data into the computer. This is done by the help of input devices like keyboard, mouse etc.
                </p>
            <p>4.	<b>Byte</b>
                A byte is a unit of computer memory or digital information that consists of eight binary digits (bits).
                NB. 1 byte stores 1 character.
                </p>
            <p>5.	<b>Binary</b>
                
                The number system used to represent digital information in computers where data is expressed by combinations of the digits 0 and 1, corresponding to power states "off" and "on" respectively.
                </p>
            <p>6.	<b>Computer Memory</b>
                This acts as a store for digital Data, processed information and programs in a computer system.
                </p>
            <p>7.	<b>RAM (Random Access Memory)</b> is temporary and volatile working memory. It holds the tasks being processed </p>
       



            <h2>What is a computer?</h2>
        <p><li> computer is an electronic device that can accept data input, process it according to some specified instructions, output the information, and store the results for future use.</li></p>
<p> 	The term computer is derived from a Latin word "Computare" which means to count or to calculate.</p>
<h2>parts of a computer</h2>
<p>A computer comprises of two major parts; System unit and  Peripheral devices.</p>
<ol>
    <li>A System Unit </li>
    <li>A Peripheral device </li>
</ol>
<h3>A System Unit (A Computer case):  </h3>
<p>This is the metallic box that houses all the internal computer components</p>
<h3>These include</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Motherboard</li>
    <li>CPU</li>
    <li>Data buses</li>
    <li>Adapter cards</li>
    <li>Expansion slots</li>
    <li>power supply unit</li>
    <li> heat sink and the hard drive</li>

</ol>
<h3>A Peripheral device </h3>
<p>refers to any computer hardware component that connects externally to the motherboard or system unit and can communicate with the CPU </p>
<h3>Examples include</h3>
<ol>
    <li>keyboard</li>
    <li>Mouse</li>
    <li>Scanner</li>
    <li>Monitor</li>
    <li>Printer</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other parts</h3>

<ul>
  <b>  <li>a.	A computer monitor </li></b>
    <p>This is a display device that outputs images and text on the screen to be viewed by the user.</p>
    <b> <li>b.	A Keyboard </li></b>
    <p>This is an input device that keys text and commands into the computer</p>
    <b><li>c.A Mouse </li></b>
<p>This is a handheld pointing input device that controls a cursor on the computer screen and inputs data by clicking

</p>
<b><li>d.	Power Cables (Cord) </li></b>
<p>This is the link between the power outlet on the wall and the power supply unit in the computer case.</p>
<b><li>e.	Visual Graphics Adapter Cable (VGA) </li></b>
<p>This  is a cable that connects to the visual graphics card on the motherboard and allows display devices to show graphics (images) </p>
<h2>Characteristics of a computer</h2>
<p>A good computer carries the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.	It works at high Speeds </li>
<li>2.	It’s Accurate</li>
<li>3.	It can store large amounts of data</li>
<li>4.	It’s Diligent </li>
<li>5.	It’s Consistent </li>
<li>6.	It’s Artificially intelligent: </li>
<li>7.	It can be automated (Spontaneous): </li>
<li>8.	It is Versatile</li>
<li>9.	Adaptability</li>
<li>10.	Need User input </li>

</ul>
<h2>factors that determine the type of a computer</h2>
<p>In general, a computer's type is determined by the following seven factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>a.	The type or nature of the CPU </li>
<li>b.	Amount of main memory the CPU can use</li>
<li>c.	The Capacity of storage devices</li>
<li>d.	The Speed of output devices</li>
<li>e.	Processing speed in millions of instructions per second (MIPS</li>
<li>f.	Number of users that can access the computer at one time</li>
<li>g.	Cost of the computer: Sincerely, many users look at the asking price of a computer to determine its type. It is known that the higher the price the better the computer set a user gets. Many branded computer sets e.g. Dell, Compaq are expensive yet cerelone computer sets of the same size are relatively cheap.</li>

</ul>


</ul>
<h3>factors would you consider before buying a PC</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>a.	The computers processor speed</li>
        <li>b.	The RAM capacity</li>
        <li>c.	The storage capacity or Hard disk capacity</li>
        <li>d.	The Operating system installed</li>
        <li>e.	The size of the output device though this is minor since it may not affect the computer performance</li>
        <li>f.	The cost of the computer </li>
        <li>g.	The manufacturers reputation</li>
        <li>h.	The computer brand names like Dell, Compaq, Hp and Apple</li>
       </ul>
